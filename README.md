This is a Rust implementation of simple but powerful sentence embedding algorithms based on
SIF and uSIF described in the following papers:

 - Sanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, and Tengyu Ma,
   [A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx),
   ICLR 2017
 - Kawin Ethayarajh,
   [Unsupervised Random Walk Sentence Embeddings: A Strong but Simple Baseline](https://aclanthology.org/W18-3012/),
   RepL4NLP 2018

## Features

 - **No GPU required**: This library runs on CPU only.
 - **Fast embeddings**: This library provides fast sentence embeddings thanks to the simple algorithms of SIF and uSIF. We observed that our SIF implementation could process ~10K–15K sentences per second on a personal desktop PC. (See [benchmarks](./benchmarks/).)
 - **Reasonable evaluation scores**: The performances of SIF and uSIF on similarity evaluation tasks do not outperform those of SOTA models such as SimCSE. However, they are not so bad. (See [evaluations](./evaluations/).)

This library will help you if

 - DNN-based sentence embeddings are too slow for your application, or
 - you do not have an option using GPUs.

## Documentation

https://docs.rs/sif-embedding/

## Getting started

See [tutorial](./tutorial).

## Benchmarks

[benchmarks](./benchmarks/) provides speed benchmarks.

We observed that, with an English Wikipedia dataset,
our SIF implementation could process ~10K–15K sentences per second
on a personal desktop PC (one core of Intel i7, 16 GB RAM).

## Evaluations

[evaluations](./evaluations/) provides tools to evaluate sif-embedding on several tasks.

## Similarity search

[qdrant-examples](./qdrant-examples/) provides an example of using sif-embedding with [qdrant/rust-client](https://github.com/qdrant/rust-client).
