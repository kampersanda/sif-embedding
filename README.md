**This is currently a prototype version.**

This is a Rust implementation of *smooth inverse frequency (SIF)* that is a simple but powerful embedding technique for sentences, described in the paper:

> [A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Sentence Embeddings](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx),
> ICLR 2017.

## Documentation

https://docs.rs/sif-embedding/

## TODO

- [ ] Add the unsupervised SIF described in [the paper](https://aclanthology.org/W18-3012/).
- [ ] Support [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) models for word embeddings.
- [ ] Support serialization/deserialization of models.
- [ ] Provide Python binding
- [ ] Conduct more evaluations.

## Evaluation

This repository provides an easy tool to evaluate this library using [SemEval STS Task](https://aclanthology.org/S16-1081/).
We show a procedure example run the evaluation, assuming you are in the root of this repository.

### 1. Download SemEval STS datasets

The [dataset-sts](https://github.com/brmson/dataset-sts) repository provides SemEval STS datasets from 2012 to 2016.
Download these and create a symbolic link to the target directory.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/brmson/dataset-sts.git
$ ln -s dataset-sts/data/sts/semeval-sts
```

### 2. Proprocess datasets

`scripts/clean_semeval_sts.py` is a script to preprocess sentences (such as tokenization, or lowercasing), referencing [the authors' code](https://github.com/PrincetonML/SIF).

```shell
$ python -m venv venv
$ . ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
$ python scripts/clean_semeval_sts.py
```

`semeval-sts-clean` will be generated.

```shell
$ ls -1 semeval-sts-clean/all
2012.MSRpar.test.tsv
2012.MSRpar.train.tsv
2012.OnWN.test.tsv
...
```

### 3. Download pretrained word embeddings

Download a pretrained model of word embeddings, such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

```shell
$ wget https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
$ unzip glove.840B.300d.zip
```

### 4. Run evaluation

`cli/semeval_sts` is a command line tool that evaluates `sif_embedding::Sif` using the SemEval STS datasets.
The SIF algorithm requires unigram probabilities.
You can use `auxiliary_data/enwiki_vocab_min200.txt` that has word frequencies (copied from [the authors' repository](https://github.com/PrincetonML/SIF)).

```shell
$ cargo run --release -p cli --bin semeval_sts -- -e glove.840B.300d.txt -w auxiliary_data/enwiki_vocab_min200.txt -c semeval-sts-clean/all
```

This will report Pearsonâ€™s $r$ between estimated similarities (i.e., cosine similarity between sentence embeddings) and gold scores, following the evaluation metric of the task.

### Experimental results

The following table shows the actual results obtained from the above procedure.
The original results by the authors are also shown as a baseline, from Table 5 (GloVe+WR) in [ICLR 2017](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx).

This library is not an exact port of the original code, and the experimental results do not exactly match.
However, similar results were obtained (except for `2012.MSRpar.test.tsv`).
