# SentEval STS Task

Here, we provide a tool to evaluate this library on [SentEval STS Task](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SimCSE/tree/main/SentEval) provided by the [SimCSE](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SimCSE) repository.

## Evaluation steps

We show steps to run the evaluation, assuming you are at this directory.

### 1. Download SentEval dataset

Run the following commands:

```shell
$ wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/datasets-for-simcse/resolve/main/senteval.tar
$ mkdir data
$ tar xvf senteval.tar -C data
```

We will use the data under the `data/STS` directory (STS12-16).

### 2. Prepare pretrained word embeddings

You need to prepare pretrained word embeddings in [finalfusion](https://docs.rs/finalfusion/) format.
Prepare a model following [finalfusion-tools/README.md](../../finalfusion-tools/README.md).

Here, we assume that you have `glove.42B.300d.fifu` in the current directory.

### 3. Evaluate

Run the following command:

```shell
$ cargo run --release --features openblas -- -d data/STS -f glove.42B.300d.fifu > score.tsv
```

## Experimental results

We show the actual results obtained by the above procedure using `glove.42B.300d.fifu` (GloVe) or `cc.en.300.fifu` (fastText).
We also show the results obtained from the original SIF paper (Table 5 in [ICLR 2017](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyK00v5xx)) and the SimCSE paper (Table 5 in [EMNLP 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.552/)).
